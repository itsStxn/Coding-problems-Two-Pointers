# Two pointers

## Difficulties

### Easy
- Palindrome Number
- Search Insert Position
- Valid Palindrome

### Medium
- Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
- 3Sum

### Hard
- Trapping Rain Water

## Patterns
- Use of **two indexes** moving through data
- Data structure is **array or string**
- Pointers move **left → right** or **both ends inward**
- Asked to find **pairs matching a condition**
- Asked to check **palindrome**
- Asked to remove or modify **elements in place**
- Asked to **partition** data
- Requires **sorted input** or sorting first
- One pointer is **slow**, the other is **fast**
- Detects **cycles** (fast and slow)
- Used to **deduplicate** sorted arrays
- Used to **merge two sorted arrays**
- Used to find **subarrays with conditions**
- Window expands and shrinks **dynamically**
- Condition determines **which pointer moves**
- Avoids **nested loops**
- Ensures **O(n)** time complexity
- Handles **overlapping pointers**
- Often combined with **sliding window**
- Used for **in-place updates**
- Requires careful handling of **pointer crossing**
- Used to **compare two sequences**
- Uses **constant extra space**
- Works well with **monotonic constraints**
- Requires thinking in terms of **range**
- Edge cases with **empty or small inputs**
- Pointer movement is **deterministic**
- Final answer depends on **pointer positions**
